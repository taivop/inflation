# Treemap of inflation in Estonia

This repo contains the code for generating an inflation treemap, for the blog post I published [here](https://taivo.ai/estonia-inflation-2022).

The code is not really optimized for clarity but if you have specific questions, email me or raise an issue on Github.

* `make_inflation_plots.ipynb` does all the data processing and visualisation.
* `data/` directory contains the tables -- check the notebook for links to original data sources.

The code here has a [permissive license](LICENSE.md) but I would appreciate a link to [taivo.ai](https://taivo.ai) or an [email](mailto:taivo@pungas.ee) if you do build on it.
